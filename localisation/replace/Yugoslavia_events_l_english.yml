 DOD_yugoslavia.1.desc:0 "Following our decision to sign a pact with Germany, a group of Air Force officers has launched a coup. The military has seized key points in Belgrade. King Petar has been declared of age, ending the regency of [YUG.GetLeader].\n\nThe general population has been supportive of the coup, with crowds chanting "Better the war than the pact, better the grave than a slave!"\n\nThe government is at a crossroads. We can support the coup, which will mean war with Germany. Or we can try to fight against it, which will tear the country apart in a bloody civil war."

Majority Croatian units have refused orders to move towards the border, and in several occasions have even opened fire on other units that were following orders.\n\nIt appears that we can no longer rely on the Croatians to support us, which has made defense of the border with Germany difficult to say the least."

 DOD_yugoslavia.20.desc:0 "Realizing a strategic weakness, the [YUG.GetAdjective] Air Force has initiated a crash program to modernize and expand its force.

 DOD_yugoslavia.30.desc:0 "\nFollowing the return of Austria to the Reich, we now share a border with [YUG.GetNameDef]. The government of [YUG.GetLeader] has been fairly quiet about their stance on our proposed reordering of Europe. Perhaps we should remind them that the time will come when they must make a choice."

 DOD_yugoslavia.31.t:0 "German pressure"
 DOD_yugoslavia.31.desc:0 "A few days ago, the German ambassador cornered [YUG.GetLeader] at a diplomatic reception. Following the Anschluss of Austria, he noted, [YUG.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] now share a common border. The ambassador assured [YUG.GetLeader] that Germany was, of course, very interested in friendly relations. \n\nHe only requested that we kept that in mind when making policy decisions in the future."
 DOD_yugoslavia.31.a:0 "How nice of him."
 DOD_yugoslavia.32.desc:0 "With [CZE.GetNameDef] out of the picture, the balance of power in south-eastern Europe has shifted dramatically.

 DOD_yugoslavia.32.b:0 "We have other plans."
 DOD_yugoslavia.33.desc:0 "Mere hours after German troops entered Prague, while the [CZE.GetAdjective] ambassador was still saying his farewells, the ambassador of [GER.GetNameDef] called at the Foreign Office. \n\nAccording to him, the German government deeply regrets that it had to take such measures in [CZE.GetNameDef], and [GER.GetLeader] is glad that the actions of [YUG.GetLeader] have not given him cause to consider such actions in regards to Yugoslavia.\n\nThe ambassador finished by expressing his hope that this would remain so in the future."
 DOD_yugoslavia.33.a:0 "How nice of him."
 DOD_yugoslavia.34.desc:0 "We now stand supreme in Europe. France was long the foundation of stability in south-eastern Europe, but now the entire area is up for grabs. We can pull all the nations there in our orbit, with no one left to stop us. \n\nIt's time to tell the Yugoslavians that they have to make a choice. Either they stand with us - or they will be swept away."
 DOD_yugoslavia.34.a:0 "Our patience with them is running thin."
 DOD_yugoslavia.34.b:0 "The Tiger cares not for the opinions of mice."
 DOD_yugoslavia.35.desc:0 "In a recent meeting at the Berghof, [GER.GetLeader] and [YUG.GetLeader] discussed the situation in Europe, and our role in it. [GER.GetLeader] insists that Yugoslavia can not avoid taking a side in the life-or-death struggle looming in the distance. Nor could Germany tolerate an unaligned country at her borders. \n\nIt would almost be preferable, he ended, if Yugoslavia choose to side with the Allies, just so everyone knew where they stood."
 DOD_yugoslavia.35.a:0 "Time is running out."
 DOD_yugoslavia.36.t:0 "The fate of Yugoslavia"
 DOD_yugoslavia.36.desc:0 "After pressing them time and time again to declare for one side, the government of [YUG.GetLeader] still clings to the idea that Yugoslavia can sit out this conflict on the side lines. Now they must face the consequences of their cowardice."
 DOD_yugoslavia.36.a:0 "If they are not with us, they are against us!"
 DOD_yugoslavia.36.b:0 "They are, and will forever remain, irrelevant."
 DOD_yugoslavia.40.desc:0 "Yugoslavia forms the lynchpin of our new Balkan strategy. They have so far remained non-committal, trading with Germany but stopping well short of joining the Axis. We should remind them that we would not tolerate trading with the enemy in case war breaks out."

 DOD_yugoslavia.41.desc:0 "[ENG.GetLeader] recently announced a diplomatic offensive in the Balkan region. Part of that advance was a private meeting between him and our ambassador in London. During this meeting, he inquired about our position with regards to Germany. [GER.GetNameDefCap], he noted, accounted for a significant amount of our non-resource exports. We would do well, he continued, to reduce our dependence on Germany."
 DOD_yugoslavia.41.a:0 "We will consider it."
 DOD_yugoslavia.42.desc:0 "The Treaty of Munich might mean peace in our time - or it may not. Germany is hardly the only country seeking to redraw the borders of Europe. The government of [YUG.GetLeader] has so far been surprisingly mum about the fate of their main armament supplier.\n\nThis has made quite a few people in the diplomatic service wonder if the Yugoslavians knew what was going to happen, and may in fact have agreed to it. \n\nWe should consider reminding them that any sort of agreement with Germany will be considered a hostile act if war were to break out."
 DOD_yugoslavia.42.a:0 "Send a Special Representative."
 DOD_yugoslavia.42.b:0 "They must still be in shock."
 DOD_yugoslavia.43.desc:0 "A Special Representative has arrived from Britain, here to discuss our opinion on the Treaty of Munich. It appears that [ENG.GetLeader] had hoped for a more firm declaration of support from us during the war scare that accompanied the negotiations. The fate of [CZE.GetNameDef], he reminded us, is tied to our own. Should [CZE.GetNameDef] fall to the Germans, we would find ourselves increasingly isolated on the continent."
 DOD_yugoslavia.43.a:0 "They are just looking for new pawns."
 DOD_yugoslavia.44.desc:0 "Despite the war raging for several months now, [YUG.GetLeader] still refuses to declare for one side, even continuing to trade with Germany while observing strict neutrality. While their support for Germany is probably not immediately critical, we must decide if we want to allow them to support a country we are actively at war with."
 DOD_yugoslavia.44.a:0 "They must make a choice."
 DOD_yugoslavia.44.b:0 "Their neutrality suits us better."
 DOD_yugoslavia.45.desc:0 "The British ambassador visited the Foreign Office today, demanding to know why we still traded with Germany. The British government, we were told, considered this to be a hostile act, and would consider 'appropriate measures' unless we stopped at once."
 DOD_yugoslavia.45.a:0 "We must make a choice."
 DOD_yugoslavia.46.desc:0 "It appears that our pressure on Yugoslavia has not had the intended effect. Rather than ceasing trade with Germany or declaring their support for the allied cause, The government of [YUG.GetLeader] clings to its neutrality and refuses to budge. Lately, MI6 has received reports that the Yugoslav government considers granting Germany the right to freely move troops through their country."
 DOD_yugoslavia.46.a:0 "They might as well be an enemy already."
 DOD_yugoslavia.46.b:0 "We shouldn't make more enemies now."
 DOD_yugoslavia.181.t:0 "Communist Sentiment Spreads in [This.GetNameDef]"
 DOD_yugoslavia.181.d:0 "With the foundation of the Pan-Slavic Worker’s Congress, it seems many of [This.GetAdjective]’s working class are beginning to support the idea of [This.GetNameDef] entering the faction as a communist state based on the [From.GetNameDef] model. Though a small movement now, many [This.GetAdjective] officials fear that if these activists are not promptly penalized for promoting this idea, [This.GetNameDef] may well find itself facing nation-wide strikes and even a rise in leftist paramilitarism."
 DOD_yugoslavia.182.t:0 "Pan-Slavic Propaganda"
 DOD_yugoslavia.182.d:0 "All across our nation, supporters of the Pan-Slavic Worker’s Congress have begun adorning the streets of [This.Capital.GetName] with posters and flyers promoting the [From.GetAdjective] model for socialism. They applaud [From.GetLeader] and his regime and believe that the [This.GetAdjective] government would benefit from social reforms akin to those found in [From.GetNameDef]. Though many suspect this is a bold attempt by [From.GetLeader] to undermine [This.GetAdjective] independence, it cannot be ignored that this propaganda is having quite an effect on the attitudes of the average [This.GetAdjective] citizen towards the prospect of communism and a united Balkan alliance."
 DOD_yugoslavia.183.t:0 "Pan-Balkan Militia"
 DOD_yugoslavia.183.d:0 "As communist sentiment continues to brew within our nation, many small paramilitary groups are beginning to form amongst our nation’s far-left. The weapons in question seem to be of Yugoslav origin, and many suspect [From.GetLeader] and his regime have plans to overthrow the [This.GetAdjective] government in favor of one more aligned with his new [From.GetRulingIdeology] state."
 DOD_yugoslavia.183.a:0 "We had better tread carefully."
 DOD_yugoslavia.184.t:0 "Communist Militants Demand a Change in Regime"
 DOD_yugoslavia.184.d:0 "Tensions between the [This.GetAdjective] government and the peasantry have reached a boiling point, with many leftist militants throughout the country arming themselves with weaponry believed to have been acquired from [From.GetNameDef]. The peasants now are demanding that [This.GetLeader] abdicates his position of power and grants it to the people he claims to represent. Their demands carry with them the implicit warning that failing to do as they ask will result in the peasantry taking up arms in the name of a new [From.GetRulingIdeology] government."

The length of time we have spent without a legitimate king on the throne has made some question the legitimacy of Karađorđević rule. However, at a recent gala in London, the young King Peter’s heart was stolen by a fair noblewoman. Already, members of the royal cabinet are discussing wedding plans to secure the King’s romantic interest with a wedding.
