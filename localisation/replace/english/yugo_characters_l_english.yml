 YUG_milan_stojadinovic_leader_desc:0 "Milan Stojadinović was born to a Serbian family in the town of Čačak in 1888. Since his youth, he was politically involved, and eventually he became a supporter of the idea of a united South Slavic country under Serbia, which he found more important than bridging the class gap. He also worked as an economist and a minister of finance, later climbing up the ranks to become the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia in 1935.\n\nHe found the country in confusion and internal instability after the recent death of Alexander I. His official government policy can be described as preserving centralist authoritarian government primarily dominated by Serbs. The biggest problem of his terms maybe the Croats, as they don't participate in the ruling coalition, and without them it's only a \"three-legged chair\". Stojadinović is also quite sympathetic to the fascist governments of Germany and Italy, which regularly causes tension not only with the Western Powers, but also with the prince regent Paul."
 YUG_peter_ii_leader_desc:0 "Peter II was crowned King of Yugoslavia in 1934 after his father was assassinated in Marseille by an IMRO terrorist. In these troubled times, many Serbs and other Yugoslav peoples view him as a symbol of survival. Now that he can excersise his full sovereign power, the kingdom should be much more stable."

 YUG_vladko_macek_leader_desc:0 "Vladko Maček was born near Zagreb to Croat and Slovene parents. After serving as a general in the Great War, he was now living in the new the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was dominated by Serbs. He became leader of the Croatian Peasant Party in 1928 and got arrested during king Alexander's dictatorship for his opposition to the government. The HSS gained popularity and eventually it became the de-facto opposition party, even attracting Serbian voters who opposed the government. Not many expected him to come to power, now that he's the Prime Minister, we can expect him to focus on expanding rights for Croatians and other minorities within Yugoslavia."
