To the Croatian nation, Islam is just as important as Catholicism, and the Croatians of Bosnia are equal to those of Croatia proper.\n\nTo reinforce this idea, many have remembered the writing of Ante Starčević, father of the Croatian nation and the founder of the Party of Rights, Ustaše's predecessor. He advocated for a Greater Croatia, and wrote that \"Bosnian Muslims are a part of the Croatian people and of the purest Croatian blood\", and called Bosniaks \"the best Croats\". Ante Pavelić has already started implementing prorams that will give Islam an official status in Croatia, equal to that of Catholicism.

Saying that this might be the start of a Chetnik revolt, Dido Kvaternik ordered to investigate the situation.\n\n50 Ustaše soldiers rounded up nearly 400 Serbs from Veljun to be tried in a 'people's court'. Even though the court was staffed with loyal Ustaše symphathizers, the verdict was that there isn't enough evidence to state that the killing was even conducted by Serbs or was politically motivated at all.\n\nOn the next day, a 'new people's court' was created, to do things 'the Ustaše way'. This time, 36 people were convicted of cooperating with the Chetniks and promptly executed.

They fight for a Socialist Federal Republic where all peoples of Yugoslavia are represented equally, and use that to gather support from many different peoples and not just the Serbs.\n\nWhile both groups say that their main goal is the liberation of Yugoslavia from the occupying forces, the reality is much more complex: they have already frequently engaged with each other and on some occasions the Chetniks have even collaborated with the enemy.

Though, in many situations, it appeared that he wasn't fully in control of his Chetnik commanders and their forces, which only further proved the ineffectiveness of the Chetniks as a resistance movement.

However, to most of the people present - even the foreign news and broadcasting agencies - it was obvious that this was a sham trial motivated only by political intentions. Tito continuosly denied that he was guilty of what he was being accused of, and the only witnesses that were allowed were those that heavily sympathised with the Chetniks - thus, all of their testimonies confirmed Tito's guilt.\n\nThe verdict was simple and predictable: guilty. Other high-ranking KPJ officials and Partisan commanders such as Edvard Kardelj, Aleksandar Ranković, Moša Pijade, Arso Jovanović and Milovan Đilas were also accused and found guilty. All of them were executed by a firing squad just two days later.\n\nThrough ideological conflict and the fight for liberation, the Chetniks have proven their dominance and liberated the Yugoslav lands.
